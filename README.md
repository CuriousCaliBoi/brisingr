=======
The first and last of all projects. 

agentic infrastructure up and running and slowly incorporate more goals complexity etc.. In my opinion projects that slowly grow more ambitious and complex are an incredible artifact. So I was thinking two dimensions and keep improving. 1. Architecture efficiency speed decoding and the other is accuracy (creativity etc).

But a great kernel to start with is the https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/caesar and https://rllm-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#key-features.

then the idea is to keep increasing complexity either implementing SOTA research tweaks and seeing its impact (could be in either dimension) Automating the infrastructure ... the options are infinite and endless. 


Again to emphasize two key components SPEED and INTELLIGENCE. Keep iterating on both.
